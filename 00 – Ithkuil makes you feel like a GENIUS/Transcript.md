# Ithkuil makes you feel like a GENIUS

notes:

(add examples of ambiguous english: we just won the lottery, I brought snacks for everyone, etc.)

Hi friends. My name is Zachary, and this is a brief introduction to the language of Ithkuil. When I write and use Ithkuil, I feel like a genius. I'll tell you why in a moment, but first I'd like to ask you two questions.

---
## What do these mean?

- We've just won the lottery!
+ His rescue was worrying.
+ I liked their gift.

notes:

First, what do these sentences mean?

The first sentence, "We've just won the lottery!", varies wildly depending on what "we" means. Maybe someone's come up to you with a winning ticket and they've decided to split the money with you. "You and I have just won the lottery." Or maybe they mean that they and their friend have won. "We've won the lottery—but you haven't."

The second sentence, "His rescue was worrying", also requires a bit of context. Was he the person rescued, or the person doing the rescuing? Does it mean that he was just saved from drowning in the sea, or did he struggle to pull someone else out of the waters?

The final sentence, "I liked their gift", is also ambiguous. Maybe I'm saying it excitedly, because I just received a painting from my friend and I love it so much that I'm going to hang it on the wall of my house. Or maybe it's a sarcastic remark, and I'm going to throw their painting out as soon as I get home. Or maybe my friend is giving the painting to someone else, and even though it's not for me, I still think it looks pretty.

All three of these have a lot of ambiguity present, even though they're quite simple. And if English struggles with examples so basic as these, how can we ever trust that we're understanding exactly what someone intended to convey? We need something better.

### We've just won the lottery.

- Imbradulföwá sle. (you and I)
- Imbradulföwá mle. (he/she/they and I)
- Imbradulföwá smle. (you and they and I)
- Imbradulföwá nle. (you all and I)

notes:

Here are four ways I might translate the first sentence into Ithkuil. The first word, *imbradulföwá*, roughly means "to have just won the lottery". It's the same across all four sentences. But the second word changes depending on the context. I could use *sle*, meaning you and I. Or I could use *pre*, meaning they (singular) and I. If all three of us won the lottery, I could even say *smle*, meaning you, they, and I. And if I'm speaking to a crowd, I might use *nle*, meaning you all and I.

One thing I'd like to point out here is how regular these words are. You can probably guess just from these examples that the L in *sle*, *mle*, *smle*, and *nle* means me. And by comparing, you can also see that the S means you. I'd like to emphasize this: these letters never change. L always means me, S always means you, and M always means they (singular).

### His rescue was worrying.

- Avvzalá hlaem<u>o</u>-acpralëi.
+ Avvzalá hlaem<u>e</u>-acpralëi.
+ Avvzalá hlaem<u>ié</u>-acpralëi.

notes:

Here's one way I might translate "His rescue was worrying": as "Avvzalá hlaemo-acpralëi." In this case, I specifically say that "the rescue where he was the agent was worrying." In plain English, it means I'm talking about sometime where he did the rescuing.

I also might say "Avvzalá hlaeme-acpralëi.". Here, I say "the rescue where he was the patient was worrying." Or in simple terms, he was the one rescued.

Notice how similar these two translations are. Everything about the sentence is identical except for the ending of **hlaemo** compared to the ending of **hlaeme**. In English, this corresponds to different word orders: "he rescued someone" versus "someone rescued him".

As a final example here, I'd like to show how we can change the ending of **hlaemo** even further. If I change it to **hlaemié**, now it means "the rescue in his presence was worrying."

The regularity and systemic nature of this word ending system means that Ithkuil can express a myriad of word roles in a given sentence without you needing to memorize the hundred fifty prepositions that English has.

If you speak Russian, German, Sanskrit, or any of the hundreds of language that use changes in a word itself to mark what it does, you can probably guess that this is called a **case system**. Ithkuil's case system is more advanced than any other, and we'll talk about it later.

## Do these words look related?

|        |        |         |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| tree   | forest | grove   |
| jungle | wood   | orchard |
|        |        |         |

notes:

Before we get to the case system, I'd like to ask my second question: do **tree**, **forest**, **grove**, **jungle**, **wood**, and **orchard** look related?

They certainly refer to similar things. A forest is a large group of somewhat similar trees. A grove is a group of similar trees. A jungle is a jumbled group of very different trees. A wood is a small forest. An orchard is a deliberately planted group of trees, typically for farming.

But English doesn't tell you. If you're learning English, you learn these six words separately. Even though the last five are all just different names for groups of trees, English forces you to think of them as entirely different.

In English, you have to learn the same word six times.

(more examples if needed:)

|        |          |          |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| person | crowd    | group    |
| mob    | team     | alliance |
|        |          |          |

|        |          |          |
| -----  | -------- | ------   |
| study  | pour out | hear     |
| learn  | drain    | listen   |
|        |          |          |

## What about these?

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| tree    | alḍal    |
| forest  | alḍaz    |
| grove   | alḍat    |
| jungle  | alḍaṭ    |
| wood    | alḍazex  |
| orchard | alḍaltex |
|         |          |

notes:

Here are the Ithkuil translations of the six words above. Notice anything?

They're all almost identical. Every single one starts with "alḑa", meaning "tree". Then, we vary the consonants and vowels that follow.

You might wonder what these literally translate to.

## Literal translations

|         |          |                     |          |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| tree    | alḍal    |                     |          |
| forest  | alḍaz    | somewhat similar    | separate |
| grove   | alḍat    | similar             | separate |
| jungle  | alḍaṭ    | dissimilar          | separate |
| wood    | alḍazex  | *(see forest)*      | small    |
| orchard | alḍaltex | purposeful, similar | small    |
|         |          |                     |          |

notes:

Each word starts with *alḑa*, for tree, and modifies it, so I've only included the modifications for brevity's sake.

Here, you can see that the word for forest, *alḑaz*, literally means a group of somewhat similar, separate trees. A grove, or an *alḑat*, is a group of very similar trees. A jungle, or an *alḑaţ*, is a group of dissimilar trees.

This grouping mechanic is already very powerful, but Ithkuil lets us do so much more.

Wood, or *alḑazex* in Ithkuil, is almost identical to the word for forest; we've just added the suffix *-ex*, meaning "small".

And orchard, or *alḑaltex*, is a purposeful, small forest. Look at it! The -t- at the end of -nļt- is the same as the -t- in grove, and the -ex- is the same as the -ex- of wood.

## Stem

|        |                        |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| amzmal | a trace left behind    |
| emzmal | a memorial left behind |
| umzmal | an archive left behind |
| omzmal | any of the above       |
|        |                        |

notes:

Now that we've seen how Ithkuil handles modifying words, here's another favorite mechanic of mine: the stem and specification system. It comes in two parts.

The first part is the stem. Each root has three stems you can choose from to add nuance to your word, or a generalized ambiguous form for when you're not sure.

For example, the root -MZM-, or trace/memorial/archive, has three core stems. The first, *amzmal*, means "for there to be a trace left behind", the second, *emzmal*, means "for there to be a memorial left behind", and the third, *umzmal*, means "for there to be an archive left behind". And if you're not sure which one you want, you can use *omzmal*, which is an ambiguous glob referring to any of the above words.

|                          |                            |                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| for a trace to exist     | for a memorial to exist    | for an archive to exist   |
| the trace itself         | the memorial itself        | the archive itself        |
| leaving a trace behind   | leaving a memorial behind  | leaving an archive behind |
| what the trace indicates | what the memorial is about | what the archive is about |

---
## Specification

|        |                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| amzmal | for a trace to be left behind     |
| amzmäl | the trace itself                  |
| amzmel | the act of leaving a trace behind |
| amzmil | what the trace indicates          |
|        |                                   |

notes:

The second part of stem and specification is specification. Specification lets you pick which aspect of a stem to focus on. The stem "trace" can turn into "for a trace to be left behind", the trace itself, the act of leaving a trace behind, or what the trace indicates.

---
## Stem and specification

|        |                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| amzmal | for a trace to be left behind    |
| emzmal | for a memorial to be left behind |
| amzmil | what the trace indicates         |
| emzmil | what the memorial indicates      |
|        |                                  |

notes:

The real power is when you combine these two, because it's an entirely regular system. *amzmal* is to *emzmal* as *amzmil* is to *emzmil*. Imagine taking an SAT test with this level of ease! Ithkuil helps you to make these types of connections between words.

And I haven't cherry-picked the root -MZM-. Every root word adheres to this stem and specification system.

## Conjugations of -L-

|       |                   |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| alal  | adult human       |
| elal  | human child       |
| olal  | any human being   |
| olat  | a group of people |
| olalt | a tribe of people |
|       |                   |

notes:

Here are some of the basic ways to modify the root -L-. The most basic form is *alal*, an adult human. Let's change it to stem 2, *elal*, meaning "human child". Or we could use the ambiguous meaning, *olal*, or "human being". Let's make it a group of people, *olat*. We could even add a sense of purpose to them with *olalt*, making them a tribe of people.

Look how simple that was! It's not conjugation; that implies irregularity and weirdness. Ithkuil's word modification system is entirely regular, and works on any word.

---
## Conjugations of -ZV-

|        |                    |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| azval  | domestic dog       |
| ezval  | gray wolf          |
| ozval  | any common canine  |
| ozvat  | a group of canines |
| ozvalt | a pack of canines  |
|        |                    |

notes:

Here are the same modifications, but on the root -ZV-, meaning canine. The default form, *azval*, means a domestic dog. We can change it to the stem 2 of *ezval*, or gray wolf. Or the ambiguous stem, *ozval*, any common canine. Then, we add the same grouping consonant of T, making it *ozvat*, a group of canines. And finally, we add a sense of purpose with the consonant L, turning it into *ozvalt*, a pack of canines.

---
## Case

|         |                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| zvala   | a dog                                   |
| zvalo   | a dog as an agent of change             |
| zvale   | a dog as something which is changed     |
| zvalai  | the dog's ... (which can be taken away) |
| zvaleö  | resulting in a dog                      |
| zvalu'i | hey, dog!                               | 
| zvali'a | at the dog's location                   |
| zvali'e | in the presence of the dog              |
|         |                                         |

notes:

We're almost out of time. Before you go, I'd like you show you one more cool feature of Ithkuil: the case system. Unlike English, which uses word order to mark what different items in a sentence do (think of the difference between "The dog chases the cat" and "The cat chases the dog"), Ithkuil modifies the final vowel of the word to indicate this.

Languages on Earth have anywhere from two to thirty-nine cases. Ithkuil has 68, but you only really need to know 9 to get started with basic sentences. Here are eight cases I might apply to the word "dog", along with their translations. Pause if you'd like to look for longer.

# Ithkuil makes you feel like a GENIUS

- Stems help add nuance
- Specifications focus on parts of a word
- Cases specify precise relationships

notes:

All of this is why when I use Ithkuil, I feel like a genius. I can start from just a handful of roots, like -ZV- for canine or -L- for person, and make dozens of words just off the top of my head. One root in Ithkuil takes you much further than the same word in English.

And because of the grammatical structures, I'll know that anyone reading what I wrote will know exactly what I meant. No more worrying about whether you're conveying something precisely enough: Ithkuil lets you be as ambiguous or precise as you want.

We're out of time. There's so many things I didn't talk about, like how you can make compound words with Concatenation, mark comparisons with Level, precisely specify time with Aspect, or mark how you know something with Validation.

If you'd like to learn more about Ithkuil, I'd recommend looking at ithkuil.net. It's a wonderful site by the creator of Ithkuil himself (did I mention Ithkuil was created by a single person?), and it goes over everything in great detail.
